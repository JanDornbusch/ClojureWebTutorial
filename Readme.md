## Contents
Instead of firing big frameworks towards our project we will go mostly step by step through the basics of webdevelopment. I will stick to the order I learned PHP in past and will possible include some sample projects later.
In order to learn all steps I am writing along different projects which more or less could be used this way in real. Following the numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) will support you to understand where we come from and go to now.

## Additionals
### Missing explanations?
Clojure is a really self explaining (by reading) language. This is why I mostly show code samples and explain basics beside them, but not the code itselfe. If there is a part you would like to know the code more in detail, let me know.

### Questions?
In case you are missing information or do not understand what I tried to express let me know and I will see if I can change it or add them within this tutorial.

### Suggestions / Contribution?
Please let me know if you are missing anything, if there are security holes, or other improvements I forgot to mention/include. Feel free to help me to improve this tutorial.

### ToDo
- To be listed here. ;-)
